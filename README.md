# Welcome to RANKEDZONE

RANKEDZONE is a mobile-friendly web application used for ranking and tracking Call of Duty: Warzone statistics, integrating with COD's official API.

A working demo is available at https://davidi-74.github.io/rankedzone/.

It was built by me using the following technologies: 

*Server-side: MongoDB, Node.JS and GraphQL.

*Client-side: React and Material-UI.

RANKEDZONE is still in development stages and is updated frequently.
